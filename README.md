# Build this project

  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```

- in firebase storage assign the following rules:
```java
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}

       PACKAGE_CHECK_SOCIAL = "\"PHISHING-SOCIAL_NETWORK\""
}
```
